Holding a Master's in Chemical Engineering, I have directed my expertise towards safety and security in the energy sector. Implementing my skills to address these critical issues, I am enthusiastic about contributing, in a technical and industrial context, to building a safer future. My experience also includes process simulation with DWSIM and Aspen Hysys, as well as the use of safety software like SEIRICH.
